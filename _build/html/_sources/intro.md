# Introduction 

This material accompanies a workshop held in July 2023 at Hamburg University by Remon Sadikni (remon.sadikni@uni-hamburg.de) and Christopher Purr (christopher.purr@uni-hamburg.de) on creating CF-conform netCDF data.
It starts by introducing the netcdf-standard and the cf-conventions. In the following, practical examples show how to create netcdf data from python and R. Lastly, the ncar climate operators are introduced.
